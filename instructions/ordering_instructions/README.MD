## Ordering from JLCPCB

There are a lot of different PCB manufacturers to choose from. These instructions show JLCPCB. You need a manufacturer that can make black PCBs if you want to use the PCBs to make a sandwich. The IR LEDs/sensors need to point to a black surface to prevent false triggers, so the bottom PCB has to be black.

1. Download the entire repo... hit the large green button that says "clone or download" [github](https://github.com/hydronics2/2019-easy-bee-counter)... navigate to the Eagle_v0.2 file. These are the PCB files. Do not use the kiCad files as there is a missing trace for the SCK pin for the itsybitsy footprint.
2. Go to [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com/quote#/), create an account and click the ORDER NOW button.
3. Add your PCB files.
