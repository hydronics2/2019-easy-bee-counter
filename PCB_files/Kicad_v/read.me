The GERBER files were developed from the kicad board files and there was a small error in the kiCAD files... so the gerber files have been removed. You now have to use the Eagle board files or generate gerber files from the eagle board files.... or a lot of PCB manufacturers will take eagle PCB files and you don't have to generate your own gerber files. You can still use the kicad files but you have to route a small trace for the SCK pin. See this bug report: https://github.com/hydronics2/2019-easy-bee-counter/issues/25
